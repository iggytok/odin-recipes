<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Amazingly easy and amazingly good... too good! This is my mother-in-law's recipe that was just recently shared. It would be a shame not to share it. Best served warm and with vanilla ice cream (of course).</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<uo>
    <li>2 (21 ounce) cans cherry pie filling</li>
    <li>1 (15.25 ounce) package white cake mix</li>
    <li>1/4 cup butter, melted</li>
    <li>1/2 cup coarsely chopped pecans</li>
</uo>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Spread cherry pie filling over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking pan. Stir cake mix and butter together into a gooey, clumpy mixture. Break into pieces between your fingers and crumble evenly on top of the cherry filling. Sprinkle pecans on top.</li>
    <li>Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown on top, 35 to 40 minutes.</li>
